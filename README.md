# Anudip Foundation - Training & Mobilization Dashboard

## 2. 📊 State-wise & Batch-wise Data Pages
 - StatePage: Displays center-wise summary data.

 - StateBatchWiseData: Visualizes batch-wise data for students using Chart.js.

 - Filtering available by center codes and batches.

 - Charts (Bar, Pie, PolarArea) open in modal views for deeper analysis.
## 3. 🖼️ Mobilization Gallery

 - Fields include:
     - Employee ID
